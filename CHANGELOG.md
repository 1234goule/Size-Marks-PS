# CHANGELOG

### 1.1 (2015-07-28)

* Fixed Photoshop CC 2015 artboards issue (Error 8182). Thanks @nvkzNemo (#17).

### 1.0 (2014-11-16)

* Limited decimal places: enjoy `39.7 pt` instead of `39.72413793 pt`. Anyway, I recommend keep a document’s resolution as a multiple of 72 ppi (#3)
* Improved a label’s appearance: now label is brighter than mark (#8)
* Improved a label’s typography: you’ll love thin space between value and measurement unit.
* Now you can change opacity of a mark. By default, the script adjust opacity to 65%. Hint: use number keys — ‘8’ for 80% or ‘5’ for 50%.
* Now you can pick color of a mark. The script uses foreground color (#6)
* ‘Install’ section was complemented with instructions for Windows computers. Thanks @adamculpepper (#4)

### 0.1.1 (2014-10-29)

Now Size Marks:
* picks Rectangular Marquee Tool before finishing (#1);
* creates a mark above the active layer;
* uses default text antialiasing instead `none`.
